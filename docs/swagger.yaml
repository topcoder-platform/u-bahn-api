      Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can specify
      further pages with the `page` parameter. You can also set a custom page
      size up to 100 with the `perPage` parameter.
      \n\nPagination response data is included in http headers. By Default, the response header contains links with `next`, `last`, `first`, `prev` resource links.\n\n**Point to note** - the page attributes will have no effect if the data is fetched from db and not from es."
